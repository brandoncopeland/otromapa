# otromapa

otromapa is a template for getting started build .js map applications.

I've incorporated the frameworks I think best get the job done and produce manageable client code, including [the ArcGIS JavaScript API](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/), [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), and [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/). Who knows? I may wake up tomorrow and like something else better. The tools used will likely change over time, but the principle of a basic application starting point with core map components common to many map apps will continue to be the goal.

otromapa is purely HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Nothing server.
